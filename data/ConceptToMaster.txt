Quiz Answer Key
The fourth animal in a line of 5 is in the fourth position. This refers to its ordinal place in the sequence.
Starting from 100, counting forward in twos: 100, 102, 104. The next two numbers are 102, 104.
The number 45 can be represented as 4 tens and 5 ones. This is shown by the place value of each digit.
Each part is called a quarter. It is written as 1/4.
To add 324 + 5: First, add the ones (4 + 5 = 9). Second, record 9 in the ones column. Third, bring down the 2 in the tens column and the 3 in the hundreds column, resulting in 329.
Multiplication as repeated addition means adding the same number multiple times. For 3 x 4, it means adding 4 three times: 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
To find out how many kg are left, subtract the sold amount from the initial amount: 25 kg - 10 kg = 15 kg.
The two hands are the hour hand (shorter hand, measures hours) and the minute hand (longer hand, measures minutes).
A good is a tangible item you can buy (e.g., book, flask), while a service is an action performed for you (e.g., haircut, transport).
If the bank is on your left, you would turn left.
