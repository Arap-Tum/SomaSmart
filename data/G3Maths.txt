The essential mathematical skills introduced for low vision pupils, as outlined in the Grade 3 Pupil's Book, cover the key areas of Numbers, Measurement, and Geometry.

### I. Numbers

The curriculum emphasizes a strong foundation in number concepts, operations, and patterns across the three terms:

**A. Number Concept and Whole Numbers**
*   **Position:** Learners are taught to name and identify positions, including ordinal numbers from **first** up to **twelfth** or **twentieth** (e.g., matching rally cars colors to position or naming the position of animals in a picture).
*   **Counting and Number Patterns:** Skills include counting forward and backward in ones, twos, fives, and tens. A significant focus is placed on identifying and completing number patterns using rules involving addition (e.g., adding 2, 5, 10, 50, or 100) or subtraction (e.g., subtracting 4, 5, 10, 50, or 150).
*   **Place Value:** Pupils learn to represent whole numbers, starting with **Tens and Ones**, and expanding to **Hundreds, Tens, and Ones**. Later, the concept of **Thousands** is introduced. Instructional methods utilize tools such as abacus, place value charts, and bundles of sticks.
*   **Reading and Writing Numbers:** Learners practice reading numbers in symbols from 1 to 1000 and converting numbers to words (e.g., "twenty five," "seventy nine," "one hundred").

**B. Fractions**
*   **Concept Introduction:** A fraction is defined as a **part of a whole** or a **part of a group**.
*   **Specific Fractions:** Introduction to recognizing and representing a **half** ($\frac{1}{2}$), a **quarter** ($\frac{1}{4}$), and an **eighth** ($\frac{1}{8}$). Activities involve folding, cutting, drawing, and shading equal parts of manilla paper cut-outs.
*   **Fraction Operations and Comparison:** Skills involve finding a fraction of a group (e.g., finding half of 20, a quarter of 32, or an eighth of 24) and comparing the relative sizes of $\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{4}$, and $\frac{1}{8}$.

**C. Operations**
The four basic operations are comprehensively covered, often utilizing visual and tactile aids like the abacus, number lines, and bundles of sticks:
*   **Addition:** Skills progress from adding three single-digit numbers to adding 3-digit numbers to 1-digit numbers, 2-digit numbers, and finally, adding two 3-digit numbers. The use of **regrouping** (carrying) is central to these skills.
*   **Subtraction:** Skills range from subtracting a 1-digit number from 2-digit numbers up to subtracting two 3-digit numbers. Learners are taught **regrouping** (borrowing) techniques. Skills also include subtracting multiples of 10.
*   **Multiplication:** Introduced as **repeated addition**. Learners master multiplication facts up to $10 \times 10$ using the **multiplication table**.
*   **Division:** Introduced conceptually through **repeated subtraction** and using the **number line**. Division skills are later taught by establishing the **relationship between division and multiplication** using the multiplication table. Division is also practiced in long form.

### II. Measurement

Learners are introduced to four key types of measurement and related operations:

*   **Length:** Measured in **metres**. Skills include measuring lengths of classroom objects and adding/subtracting lengths in metres. Estimating length is also an important activity.
*   **Mass:** Measured in **kilograms (kg)**. Skills include measuring mass using 1 kg masses and a beam balance. Learners practice estimating mass and adding or subtracting masses in kilograms.
*   **Capacity:** Measured in **litres**. Skills include using a 1-litre container to measure the capacity of different vessels (e.g., buckets, jugs). Estimation, addition, and subtraction of capacity in litres are taught.
*   **Time:** Focuses on the clock face, identifying the **hour hand** and **minute hand**. Learners practice reading and telling time by the hour ("o'clock"), time **"past"** the hour (e.g., half past, quarter past), and time **"to"** the hour (e.g., 20 minutes to 10). They also learn to add and subtract time expressed in hours and minutes.
*   **Money:** Learners identify Kenyan currency notes (Sh. 50 to Sh. 1000). Practical skills involve **counting money**, handling **change** (denominational exchange), and calculating the **balance** (subtraction in shopping activities). They also learn about **spending and saving** and distinguishing between **goods and services** and **needs and wants**.

### III. Geometry

The geometry section includes basic spatial awareness and shape recognition:

*   **Position and Direction:** Skills involve interpreting movement and location using pictures/maps, specifically practicing turning to the **right** and turning to the **left** to navigate between points (e.g., school, hospital, bank).
*   **Shapes and Patterns:** Learners identify common geometric shapes and differentiate between **straight** and **curved** lines (e.g., determining the lines that make up a rectangle or an oval). They also work on **pattern making** using shapes.

introduces several key mathematical concepts across three terms, which are generally revisited and expanded upon in each subsequent term.
Here is a summary of the key mathematical concepts and their child-friendly definitions:
1. NUMBERS
• Number Concept
    ◦ Definition: This is about understanding the order of things, like who is first, second, or third in a line. It also teaches you to count numbers forwards and backwards, and recognise their positions.
• Whole Numbers
    ◦ Definition: These are the regular counting numbers like 1, 2, 3, and so on, including zero. You learn how to count them, put them in order, find patterns, and understand what each digit means in a number, such as how many tens or hundreds there are. You also practice writing numbers as words and symbols.
• Fractions
    ◦ Definition: Fractions are parts of a whole thing or a group. For example, if you cut an apple into two equal parts, each part is a "half" (1/2). If you cut it into four equal parts, each part is a "quarter" (1/4). You also learn how to compare which fraction is bigger or smaller.
• Addition
    ◦ Definition: Addition is putting numbers together to find a total amount. You learn how to add small numbers and bigger numbers, even when you need to "carry over" to the next place value, like when 10 ones become 1 ten. It includes adding single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.
• Subtraction
    ◦ Definition: Subtraction is taking one number away from another to find how many are left or the difference between them. You practice taking away small numbers and larger numbers, and sometimes you need to "borrow" from a bigger place value to make it work. It covers subtracting single-digit, two-digit, and three-digit numbers.
• Multiplication
    ◦ Definition: Multiplication is a quick way to add the same number many times. It's like having groups of things, and you want to know the total. You can use a multiplication table to help find the answer quickly. It covers multiplying single-digit numbers and by 10.
• Division
    ◦ Definition: Division is sharing things equally into groups, or finding out how many times one number fits into another. It's like doing multiplication backwards! You can think of it as repeatedly taking away the same number, or using a multiplication table.
2. MEASUREMENT
• Length
    ◦ Definition: Length is how long something is, or the distance from one end to the other. You measure length using units like metres, and you also learn how to guess how long something is (estimate) and then check your guess. You can also add and subtract different lengths.
• Mass
    ◦ Definition: Mass is how heavy something is. You measure mass in kilograms (kg), often using a balance scale. You also practice guessing how heavy something is (estimating), checking your guess, and adding and subtracting different weights.
• Capacity
    ◦ Definition: Capacity is how much liquid a container can hold, like how much water a bottle can fit. You measure capacity using litres. You learn to guess how much a container can hold (estimate) and then measure it to check, and also add and subtract volumes of liquids.
• Time
    ◦ Definition: Time is about knowing when things happen. You learn to read clocks with hour and minute hands to tell the hour and minutes, like "3 o'clock," "half past 2," or "quarter to 12." You also learn how to add and subtract amounts of time.
• Money
    ◦ Definition: Money is what we use to buy things. You learn about different money notes (like Kenyan shillings), how to count money, and how to get "change" (smaller money back) or understand the "balance" (money left over) after buying something. You also explore the concepts of needs, wants, spending, and saving money, and adding and subtracting money.
3. GEOMETRY
• Position and Direction
    ◦ Definition: Position and Direction is about knowing where things are and how to move from one place to another. You learn how to follow instructions like turning right or left to find your way to places like school, the bank, or a shop.
• Shapes
    ◦ Definition: Shapes are the different forms we see, like rectangles, triangles, and ovals. You learn to name them and see if they are made of straight lines or curved lines. You also learn to create patterns using different shapes


    Certainly, let's delve deeper into the types of calculations and the methods used in the Grade 3 mathematics curriculum for learners with low vision, as presented in the sources. The curriculum emphasizes **step-by-step procedures** and often incorporates **visual or tangible aids** such as abacuses, bundles of sticks, number lines, and place value charts to support understanding.

Here's a detailed look at calculations across various mathematical concepts:

### 1. NUMBERS

**a. Whole Numbers: Counting and Number Patterns**
The curriculum introduces counting in various intervals and identifying patterns, which are foundational to more complex calculations.
*   **Counting in ones, twos, fives, and tens:** Learners practice filling in missing numbers in sequences, both forwards and backwards.
    *   **Example (Counting forward in ones):** 105, 106, 107, ______, _______, 110, 111. (Answers: 108, 109)
    *   **Example (Counting backwards in ones):** 600, 599, 598, ______, ______, 595, 594. (Answers: 597, 596)
    *   **Example (Counting forward in twos):** 302, 304, 306, 308, 310, 312.
    *   **Example (Counting backwards in twos):** 730, 728, 726, 724, 722, 720.
    *   **Example (Counting forward in tens):** 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140.
    *   **Example (Number Pattern with rule identification):** For 422, 424, 426, 428, _____, ______. The rule is to add 2 to the previous number. So, the next numbers are 430 and 432.
*   **Place Value:** Learners calculate the value of digits in a number.
    *   **Example (Tens and Ones):** 36 can be shown as 3 tens and 6 ones using bundles of sticks or an abacus. Similarly, 45 is 4 tens and 5 ones.
    *   **Example (Hundreds, Tens, Ones):** The number 253 is shown as 2 hundreds, 5 tens, and 3 ones, both on a chart and an abacus. 798 is 7 hundreds, 9 tens, 8 ones.

**b. Fractions: Calculating Parts of a Group**
The curriculum introduces fractions by calculating a specific part of a given group.
*   **Example (Half of a group):** Half of 4 = 2. This is illustrated by having a whole group of 4, then splitting it into two equal parts to show that each part is 2. Similarly, half of 6 is 3.
*   **Example (Quarter of a group):** A group of 16 items can be divided into four equal groups, with one group representing a quarter. So, a quarter of 16 is 4.
*   **Example (Eighth of a group):** An eighth of 32 items is found by dividing the group into eight equal parts, resulting in 4 items per part.

**c. Addition: Combining Numbers**
Addition is taught progressively, from single-digit to three-digit numbers, with and without regrouping (carrying over). Visual aids are frequently employed.
*   **Adding 3-digit number to a 1-digit number (without regrouping):**
    *   **Using an Abacus:** To calculate **471 + 3**:
        1.  Represent 471 on the abacus (1 ring in ones, 7 in tens, 4 in hundreds).
        2.  Add 3 rings to the ones spike, making 4 rings.
        3.  The result is 4 rings in ones, 7 in tens, and 4 in hundreds, so **474**.
*   **Adding 3-digit number to a 1-digit number (with regrouping):**
    *   **Using an Abacus:** To calculate **687 + 4**:

        2.  Add 4 rings to the ones spike, resulting in 11 rings.
        3.  Remove 10 rings from the ones spike and add 1 ring to the tens spike (regrouping). This leaves 1 ring in the ones spike and makes 9 rings in the tens spike.
        4.  The result is 6 hundreds, 9 tens, and 1 one, so **691**.
    *   **Column Method:** For **687 + 8**:
        1.  Add ones: 7 + 8 = 15. Regroup 15 as 1 ten and 5 ones. Write 5 in the ones column, take 1 to the tens column.

        4.  The result is 3 hundreds, 8 tens, 2 ones, so **382**.
    *   **Column Method:** For **246 + 37**:
        1.  Add ones: 6 + 7 = 13. Regroup as 1 ten and 3 ones. Write 3, carry 1 to tens.
        2.  Add tens: 1 (carried over) + 4 + 3 = 8. Write 8.
        3.  Bring down 2 hundreds. The answer is **283**.
*   **Adding Three Single-Digit Numbers:**
    *   **Using a Number Line:** For **3 + 4 + 2**:
        1.  Start at 0, skip 3 steps forward to 3.
        2.  Skip another 4 steps forward to 7.
        3.  Skip another 2 steps forward to 9. The final point is 9. So, **3 + 4 + 2 = 9**.
*   **Adding Two 3-Digit Numbers (without regrouping):**
    *   **Using Place Value Tins (Sticks):** For **342 + 125**:
        1.  Represent 342 with sticks in hundreds, tens, and ones tins.
        2.  Add 125 by adding sticks to corresponding tins.
        3.  Count the total sticks: 7 in ones, 6 in tens, 4 in hundreds. The answer is **467**.

        1.  Represent 36 as 3 bundles of tens and 6 single sticks.
        2.  Cannot take 7 sticks from 6 sticks. Untie 1 bundle of tens to get 10 single sticks. Add to 6 single sticks to make 16.
        3.  Remove 7 single sticks from 16, leaving 9 single sticks.
        4.  Count remaining: 2 bundles of tens and 9 single sticks. The answer is **29**.
    *   **Column Method:** For **63 - 4**:

        4.  Subtract 2 hundreds from the remaining 3 hundreds to get 1 hundred. The answer is **171**.

**e. Multiplication: Repeated Addition and Tables**
Multiplication is introduced as repeated addition and through the use of multiplication tables.
*   **Repeated Addition:**
    *   **Example:** To calculate **2 x 3**: This is shown as 3 + 3 = 6.
    *   **Example:** To calculate **3 x 4**: This is shown as 4 + 4 + 4 = 12.
*   **Using a Multiplication Table:**
    *   **Example:** To calculate **7 x 5**:
        1.  Find 7 in the first row and 5 in the first column of the table.
        2.  Move along the row and column until they meet.
        3.  The number where they meet is 35. So, **7 x 5 = 35**.
    *   **Multiplication by 10:** The table is used to show, for example, that **7 x 10 = 70**.
*   **Word Problems:** Calculations are applied in context, e.g., if a pencil costs Sh. 10, 5 pencils cost 5 x Sh. 10 = Sh. 50.

**f. Division: Repeated Subtraction and Tables**
Division is taught as repeated subtraction and by relating it to multiplication tables.
*   **Repeated Subtraction:**
    *   **Example:** To calculate **8 ÷ 2**:
        1.  Subtract 2 from 8 repeatedly: 8 - 2 = 6 (1 time), 6 - 2 = 4 (2 times), 4 - 2 = 2 (3 times), 2 - 2 = 0 (4 times).
        2.  Since 2 was subtracted 4 times, **8 ÷ 2 = 4**.
    *   **Using a Number Line:** For **12 ÷ 3**:
        1.  Start at 12 and skip backwards in 3s (12 to 9, 9 to 6, 6 to 3, 3 to 0).
        2.  Count the number of skips made (4 skips). So, **12 ÷ 3 = 4**.
*   **Using a Multiplication Table (Relationship to Multiplication):**
    *   **Example:** To calculate **24 ÷ 6**:
        1.  Using the multiplication table, find 24.
        2.  Move across to find 6 in the first column, and up to find 4 in the first row.
        3.  This shows that 6 x 4 = 24, therefore **24 ÷ 6 = 4**.
    *   **Long Division Format:** For **32 ÷ 4**:
        1.  Write in long division format.
        2.  Use the multiplication table to find what number multiplied by 4 gives 32 (which is 8).
        3.  Write 8 on top of the division sign. Multiply 8 by 4 (32) and subtract from 32 to get 00. So, **32 ÷ 4 = 8**.

### 2. MEASUREMENT (Involving Calculations)

Calculations are also integrated into measurement topics, applying the basic operations.

*   **Length:**
    *   **Adding Lengths:** If a distance is 270m and another is 170m, their total is 270m + 170m = 440m.
    *   **Subtracting Lengths:** If a string is 64m long and 31m is used, 64m - 31m = 33m remains. Another example is 625m - 450m = 175m.
*   **Mass:**
    *   **Adding Mass:** Total mass of 5kg potatoes and 3kg maize is 5kg + 3kg = 8kg.
    *   **Subtracting Mass:** If Halima has 18kg of potatoes and gives away 5kg, she is left with 18kg - 5kg = 13kg.
*   **Capacity:**
    *   **Adding Capacity:** If John buys 4 litres of milk and his grandmother brings 3 litres, he has 4 litres + 3 litres = 7 litres.
    *   **Subtracting Capacity:** A car with 26 litres of petrol that uses 14 litres will have 26 litres - 14 litres = 12 litres left.
*   **Time:**
    *   **Adding Time:** If John cycles for 2 hours 45 minutes and Rose walks for 4 hours 5 minutes, altogether they use 2 hrs 45 mins + 4 hrs 5 mins = 6 hours 50 minutes.
    *   **Subtracting Time:** If Mr. Omolo takes 1 hour 45 minutes and Miss Claire takes 1 hour 15 minutes, the difference is 1 hr 45 mins - 1 hr 15 mins = 30 minutes.
*   **Money:**
    *   **Adding Money:** Sh. 50 + Sh. 100 = Sh. 150. Peter spent Sh. 176 on sugar and Sh. 206 on flour, totalling Sh. 176 + Sh. 206 = Sh. 382.
    *   **Subtracting Money (Balance/Change):** If Jane has a Sh. 500 note and buys a book for Sh. 300, her change/balance is Sh. 500 - Sh. 300 = Sh. 200. Maurice had Sh. 32 and spent Sh. 16, leaving him with Sh. 32 - Sh. 16 = Sh. 16.

The curriculum consistently demonstrates calculations through explicit examples, often broken down into numbered steps, making the learning process clear and accessible for low vision learners. These methods are designed to build a solid understanding of fundamental arithmetic operations and their practical application.

| **1.** | A fish pond had 508 fish. On one day, 67 died. How many were left? | **Operation:** Subtraction ($508 - 67$)<br><br>**Step 1: Regroup.** Regroup 1 hundred to 9 tens and 10 ones (508 becomes 4 hundreds, 9 tens, 18 ones).<br>**Step 2: Subtract the Ones.** 18 ones – 7 ones = 11 ones. Write down 1. (Wait, $18-7=11$, this suggests an issue in the source logic or a misstep in grouping. Assuming $18-7=11$ is simplified to 1 one in the ones column and carrying 1 ten up). Since standard subtraction requires $18-7=11$, this problem implies multi-level borrowing. Let's stick to the arithmetic: 18 - 7 = 11. No, $8-7=1$. $0-6$ needs borrowing. 508 becomes 4(10)8. Then 4(9)(18). $18-7=11$. No, that's not right. Let's re-read the numbers: 508 - 67. **Correct Step 1 (Regrouping):** Regroup 1 hundred (500 becomes 4 hundreds and 10 tens). Then regroup 1 ten (10 tens becomes 9 tens, 8 ones become 18 ones). The number is now 49(18).<br>**Step 2: Subtract the Ones.** 18 ones – 7 ones = 11 ones. (Still incorrect. Reworking arithmetic assuming standard subtraction: $508 - 67$).<br>**Standard Subtraction:** $8 - 7 = 1$. $0 - 6$: Borrow from 5. $508 \to 4(10)8$. $10 - 6 = 4$. $4 - 0 = 4$. Answer: 441. <br>**Step-by-Step based on Low Vision curriculum flow:** 508 - 67. Subtract 7 from 8: $8 - 7 = 1$. Subtract 6 tens from 0 tens: Borrow 1 hundred from 500 (leaving 400). The 100 makes 10 tens. $10 - 6 = 4$ tens. Bring down 4 hundreds.<br>**Answer:** 441 fish were left. |
